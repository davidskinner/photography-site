                    I love capturing moments that will last a lifetime. Moments like that gentle tear rolling down your cheek as you say "I do",
                    or those few, sweet newly-married moments after the ceremony should be immortalized and cherished for
                    a lifetime.

                    I have been a photographer for seven years now, and my favorite thing to capture is weddings. I have shot weddings all over
                    Arkansas in barns to fancy, historic buildings. Most importantly though, I have had the truest privilege
                    of seeing my images in the homes of some of the friends I have made along the way.
